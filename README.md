Aldiyar's Portfolio — site1101_Aldiyar_Temirbek

Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio. This is my space where I share my journey in web development and showcase the projects I've been working on as a student at ADA University.

What's This About?
I'm Aldiyar, a first-year Computer Science student at ADA University in Azerbaijan, originally from Astana, Kazakhstan. This portfolio was created as part of my SITE1101 course and serves as a showcase of my learning progress in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Check it out live: [https://m1ser1ti.github.io/site1101_Aldiyar_Temirbek/](https://m1ser1ti.github.io/site1101_Aldiyar_Temirbek/)

What's Under the Hood

I built this site with:
- HTML5 — Clean, semantic markup for good structure
- CSS3 — Modern styling with custom variables for a light/dark theme that switches automatically
- Vanilla JavaScript — Interactive features like image sliders and theme toggling (no frameworks, just pure JS!)
- Responsive Design — Works beautifully on phones, tablets, and computers

My Projects

Project 1: Logic Gates
Built physical logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, XOR) using breadboards, transistors, and LEDs. Teamwork, lab safety, and a lot of learning. Check out the [video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/D7JjSiBx24s)!

Project 2: Hour of Code
Working on an event to teach school kids the basics of programming. Exciting stuff — more updates coming!
