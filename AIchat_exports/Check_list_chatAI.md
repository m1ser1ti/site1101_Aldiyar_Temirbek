User: What have I not done yet on the site?
Ai_agent: Here is what’s pending: fix asset paths, rewrite README to be friendlier, add .gitignore, add Jekyll _config.yml, and wire the contact form action. Want me to do item 1 first?

User: Yes, fix the typo paths in projects.html.
Ai_agent: Fixed image paths from assest-project1 to assets/project1 and removed fallback onerror handlers.

User: Make the README more human.
Ai_agent: Rewrote README with a friendly overview, features, structure, run steps, projects, and contacts.

User: Add gitignore and config.
Ai_agent: Added .gitignore for OS/IDE/temp/node/python/Jekyll artifacts and created _config.yml with site metadata, excludes, and defaults.

User: Update the contact form action.
Ai_agent: Set contact.html form action to https://formspree.io/f/mbqwlqbw and kept the “Send Message” button label.

User: How do I export the AI chat?
Ai_agent: Use the editor’s Export chat to Markdown, save files, and I can combine them. Example: cat chat_exports/*.md > chat_exports/all_chats_combined.md.

User: Can you do it if I give permission?
Ai_agent: I need the exported files; once they’re in chat_exports/, I can stitch them with separators.

User: Make me a chat export.
Ai_agent: No exports found yet; please place the .md files in chat_exports/ so I can combine them.

User: Please rewrite our entire chat into English in Check_list_chatAI.md as a dialogue with “User:” and “Ai_agent:”.
Ai_agent: Adding the conversation summary in English with dialogue labels (this file).
