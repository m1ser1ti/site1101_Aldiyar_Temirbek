**User:** 10% bonus will be provided for using Jekyll to develop your website. SITE 1101: Principles of Information Systems
Individual Project: Personal Website

The loud claim fades; the quiet deed remains ~ Tao Te Ching

You will develop your understanding of programming by developing a personal portfolio website. This project aims to provide you skills in coding with GenAI, gain experience with git version control and Github platform, and host your static (HTML/CSS & JavaScript-based) personal portfolio website on Github Pages.

**Preparation**
- Set up git and Github by watching this tutorial. Understand the purpose of each. It will drastically help you both in your current project and in future courses.
- Study basics of HTML/CSS by watching this tutorial.
- Choose a website design in https://personalsites.es/. Aim at selecting a design that is neither too complicated nor too minimalistic to imitate.

**Development**

Start developing your website. You should have already installed VSCode or Cursor (see Syllabus) which comes with an AI agent, as well as LiveServer extension which will help you during the website development.

Your website should have the following pages:
- Home Page with a profile photo and a text summarizing who you are, etc.
- About Page introducing your background, qualifications, conducted activities, (not necessarily only in this course), etc.
- Projects Page introducing your projects (each should have title, description, photos/screenshots, etc.). It must include Project 1, and, optionally, Project 2 (Hour of Code). Any other project that you wish to add can also be added.
- Any other page that you would like to add (e.g. resume, blog, etc).

Additionally, make sure to have:
- Navigation bar (menu) and Footer.
- Icons leading to your Github and Codecademy profiles (you can also add additional links).
- In the website, you should also have a link to the Github repository of the website. Your repository should be public.
- Responsive design which will adapt your website for phones and tablets.
- Modularized and clean code/repository structure.

Make commits. Make sure to commit your progress with three main commands consistently: git status, git add and git commit you will be using often when making important additions to the website. Your Github repository should show these commits (you will use git push).

Export your AI chat. Cursor AI chat (similarly VSCode) has an option to export chat as a markdown file (.md). The file should show your conversation with AI during the whole development progress.

Host your website on Github Pages. Follow the instructions to activate your website for the web. It should be a quick process once you understand how Git/Github works. Your website will be served at https://[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME].github.io and should be accessible to anyone on the web. If you already have your website hosted in that URL, you can host new project at https://[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME].github.io/site1101.

**10% bonus will be provided for using Jekyll to develop your website.**

**Submission & Grading**

You will submit three items:
1. Link to your website.
2. Link to your public Github repository.
3. AI chat markdown file.

Make sure that there is no typo and the links are correct.

The grading checklist (yes/no) corresponding to the requirements above is as follows:
- Repository link not submitted or is private or doesn't have website code (-50 pts)
- AI chat markdown file not submitted or is unrelated (-25 pts)
- Github Pages website link not submitted or link doesn't work/exist (-25 pts)
- The website was built with Jekyll (+10 pts)
- Home page about student exists (10 pts)
- About page about student exists (10 pts)
- Projects page with at least Project 1 (title + description + image) exists (10 pts)
- There are no major design issues (missing images, unreadable text, etc) (10 pts)
- Navigation bar and footer are present (10 pts)
- There are icons leading to student's GitHub and Codecademy profiles (10 pts)
- There is a link leading to the website's public GitHub repository (10 pts)
- Multiple commits on the repository showing progress of development (10 pts)
- Responsive design works on narrow screens (10 pts)
- Code is clean and modular (code/files/folders nicely organized) (10 pts)

When submitting, make sure to consider video upload time and other logistical issues. Deadline policy is noted in the syllabus. Good luck!

**AI_agent:** I'll help you implement Jekyll for your website to earn that 10% bonus! Let me first examine your current website structure and then convert it to Jekyll.

*AI examines the existing HTML files: index.html, about.html, projects.html, and contact.html*

I can see you have a well-structured website with:
- A home page with profile information
- An about page with image sliders
- A projects page showcasing your work
- A contact page with a form
- Consistent navigation and theme toggle functionality

Now I'll create a plan to convert this to Jekyll:

**Todo List for Jekyll Implementation:**
1. Create Jekyll configuration files (_config.yml, Gemfile, and .gitignore)
2. Create _layouts directory with default layout template
3. Create _includes directory for reusable components (header, footer, navigation)
4. Convert existing HTML pages to use Jekyll front matter and layouts
5. Test the Jekyll site locally
6. Ensure GitHub Pages deployment configuration is correct

Let me start implementing Jekyll step by step.

**User:** I want you to rewrite our entire chat into Jekyll_chatAI.md, translate it to English, and format it as a dialogue like in books (User: ... then AI_agent: ...)

---

**AI_agent:** I've documented our conversation in the Jekyll_chatAI.md file in English with dialogue format. The file now contains our discussion about implementing Jekyll for your website project to earn the 10% bonus points.

The conversation has been formatted as:
- **User:** for your messages
- **AI_agent:** for my responses

This creates a clear dialogue structure similar to books, making it easy to follow the conversation flow for your project submission.
